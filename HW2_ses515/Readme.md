## Collaboration

I learned something from everyone I spoke to this week, from Rebecca who caught that I was working in the wrong kernel, to Prince, who helped me with my environmental variables. I worked primarily with Prince and Dana, who I worked with the parse the json file and create the scripts. Dana and I worked together on the third assignment, to use pandas to read from the csv. I was largely along for the ride this week.

## Notes

For most of the weekend I was unable to access Jupytr hub from compute. Instead, I used anaconda to work from my local machine, pushed to github, and pulled down on compute from there. The inconsistencies with the data facility were particularly trying this week. 

When trying to set my default text editor, I messed up my bash_profile. I spent much of my time trying to reset environmental variables and alises before I could move forward on this this week.
