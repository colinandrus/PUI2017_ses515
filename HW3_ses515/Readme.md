I worked with Julian and Juan on the first assignment. Juan and I worked to understand what was needed in the formula for each distribution while Julian worked on the for loop which could generate all of the distributions. From there, we generated the plots and distributions together, with Juan and Julian leading the way on the histogram.

The three of us also developed the question for the citibike section, although we worked independently on creating our graphs. I struggled to read in the data at office hours, but ended up reading in through gws. The lab was largely done in class, but Yuwen showed me how to write the hypothesis equations using markdown.
