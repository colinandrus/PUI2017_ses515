I worked with Julian and Juan on the first assignment. Juan and I worked to understand what was needed in the formula for each distribution while Julian worked on the for loop which could generate all of the distributions. From there, we generated the plots and distributions together. I learned a ton at office hours and from Juan and Julian who lead the way on the code. 

The three of us also developed the question for the citibike section, although we worked independently on creating our graphs. The lab was largely done in class, but Yuwen showed me how to write the hypothesis equations using markdown.
